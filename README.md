attiny85 sample apps and libraries
==================================

Introduction
------------

Attiny85 MCU - some tests and example apps + I2C and LCD libraries

### Low power LED blink (lp_blink.c)

LED blink firmware putting the MCU into power-down state
between the LED changes.

### Charlie (charlie.c)

A simple demonstration of PWM LED charlieplexing.

### I2C LCD display demonstration (main.c)

MQ6 readout and a progress bar on a LCD. 

### MQ6 gas sensor demonstration (mq_6.c)

MQ6 readout and a progress bar on a LCD. 

### Annoyatron

A simple circuit making different noises at random
intervals when left in the dark. The sounds/noises are:

 - `snd/snd_cricket.c` - cricket chirp
 - `snd/snd_droplet.c` - leaking faucet
 - `snd/snd_insect.c` - buzzing insect
 - `snd/snd_scifi.c` - sci-fi/robot sounds
 - `snd/snd_water.c`Â - running water
 - `snd/snd_whisper.c` - scary whispers

Connections are simple:
 - PB1/PB4 - piezo buzzer
 - PB2 - LDR (light-dependent resistor) to VCC and a 10k resistor to GND


### Simple Geiger Counter firmware (geiger.c)

Simple Geiger Counter based on ATTINYx5 MCU.
Tracks the radiation dose, but only signals two
alarm levels on a two-color LED. Here is a veroboard-friendly PCB:

The firmware is designed as a simple and lightweight
cooperative scheduler maintaining in every state
the lowest power level possible:

Configuring
-----------

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DAVR_MCU=attiny85 \
      -DAVR_PROGRAMMER=avrisp -DAVR_PROGRAMMER_PORT=/dev/ttyACM0 \
      -DMCU_FREQ=8000000 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchain-avr-gcc.make ..

make -j
```
